### ðŸŒ± My best projects
<img align="right" src="https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/file/project/iat/OptoFence/optofence_overview-2-300x298.jpg" width="70">
- <a href="https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/project/optofence/">Trajectory Prediction of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for image stabilization of a telescope system</a> as Bachelor Thesis. I researched state of the art methods and implemented a program to improve on the previous system using Kalman Filters, OpenCV and C++. <img align="right" src="assets/transmission_box.png" width="150">
- <a href="https://github.com/majvie/transmission_box">Transmission Box</a> â€“ Design, Calculations and Dimensioning of a Transmission Box, clutches and roll for roll forming according to DIN and ISO standards. As the team leader I was responsible for the calculations and design of parts of the transmission as well as the hydraulically actuated multi-plate clutch and for project management. <img align="right" src="assets/line_follower.png" width="150">
- <a href="https://github.com/majvie/line_follower">Line Follower</a> â€“ Design, Implementation, and real-life testing of HDD-based Line-Follower involving writing code in C for microcontrollers, wiring of electrical components and choice of motors/sensors.
