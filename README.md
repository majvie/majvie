<h2> Hi there, I'm Maximilian Vieweg æ±Ÿå®‡é˜³!</h2>
<p><em>
I'm an Erasmus Mundus Robotics Engineering Master student at the <a href="https://www.master-mir.eu/">TÃ©cnico Lisboa and the UniversitÃ© de Toulon</a> applying for 2023 summer internship programmes right now. <br>
Among top 15% of student cohort during my bachelor's at the Technical University of Vienna following an individual study plan, while taking courses in Robotics, Microcontrollers and Machine design.

### ðŸŒ± My best projects

- <img align="right" src="https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/file/project/iat/OptoFence/optofence_overview-2-300x298.jpg" width="65" style="margin-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 15px; float: left; border-radius: 10%;"/> <a href="https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/project/optofence/">Trajectory Prediction of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for image stabilization of a telescope system</a> as Bachelor Thesis. I researched state of the art methods and implemented a program to improve on the previous system using Kalman Filters, OpenCV and C++.
- <img align="right" src="assets/fish_classification.png" width="65" style="padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 15px; float: right;clear:both;"><a href="https://github.com/majvie/deep_learning_notebooks">fish classification using CNNs</a> â€“ This project involves using CNNs and PyTorch to classify fish images into different categories. We will train a model on a dataset of fish images and use it to predict the class of new, unseen images. Finally its performance is compared to a fine-tuned AlexNet and a MobileNet to explore Transfer Learning.
- <img align="right" src="assets/maritime_object_detection.png" width="150" style="padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 15px; float: right;clear:both;"><a href="https://github.com/majvie/deep_learning_notebooks">detecting sailboats at sea</a> â€“ A Faster R-CNN is trained to detect and categorize maritime objects, such as sailboats and buoys, at sea. Each detection is visualised with a bounding box and relevant metrics are displayed next to the image category. For this purpose images are filtered from the Pascal VOC for training.
- <img align="right" src="assets/transmission_box.png" width="150" style="padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 15px; float: right;clear:both;border-radius: 10px;"><a href="https://github.com/majvie/transmission_box">Transmission Box</a> â€“ Design, Calculations and Dimensioning of a Transmission Box, clutches and roll for roll forming according to DIN and ISO standards. As the team leader I was responsible for the calculations and design of parts of the transmission as well as the hydraulically actuated multi-plate clutch and for project management.
